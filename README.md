Here is a draft README for an open source AGI system called BabyAGI4FOSS:

# BabyAGI4FOSS

BabyAGI4FOSS is an open source artificial general intelligence system designed to learn and develop cognitive abilities like a human baby. 

## Overview

This project aims to create an AGI that can:

- Learn natural language from conversations and text
- Develop reasoning, planning, and problem-solving skills 
- Form a knowledge base about the world
- Exhibit social abilities like empathy and creativity

BabyAGI4FOSS is built using an autofoss approach - the source code is entirely open for community contribution, review, and auditing. We believe openness and transparency is essential for developing safe and ethical AGI.

## Getting Started

To use BabyAGI4FOSS:

- Install the latest version from the releases page
- Run `babyagi4foss` to launch the interface
- Talk to the agent using natural language to teach it about the world

We welcome contributions from the community! You can get involved by:

- Submitting issues and feature requests
- Contributing code via pull requests
- Expanding the knowledge content
- Testing and providing feedback

Please see the code of conduct and contribution guidelines for more details.

## Roadmap

Current capabilities are limited, but we aim to replicate more sophisticated infant cognition over time. The roadmap includes:

- Object permanence
- Cause and effect understanding 
- Symbolic thought
- Theory of mind
- Physical knowledge
- Math and logic skills

Check the issues page for specific goals and upcoming enhancements.

Let's work together to build a free, decentralized AGI that benefits all humanity! The future starts with BabyAGI4FOSS today.
